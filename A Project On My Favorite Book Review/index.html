Clear introduces the concept of atomic habits, which are tiny, consistent changes that may seem insignificant at first but, when practiced consistently, can have a profound impact on one's life. The author argues that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, and by focusing on making small improvements consistently, individuals can achieve remarkable long-term results. The book is divided into four parts, each addressing a different aspect of habits. They are:</p><h3>

He emphasizes the importance of identity in habit formation, stating that real change happens when individuals shift their identity and start believing in the possibility of becoming the person they want to be.</p>
